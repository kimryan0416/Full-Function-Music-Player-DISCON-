You've got a strange voice, and a curious appearance 
So at times you were called unpleasant
But because your heart isn’t beating
Your feelings weren’t hurt.

First impression was a minus…
My bias changed,
Drifting on, the months fly by
And again I’ve made a song like this

Hello. Nice to meet you.
Goodbye. See you tomorrow.

Unchanging love and fleeting passion,
From your point of view, are nothing but code
Righteousness, evil, and days unrecoverable
In front of you, they couldn’t matter less

I’m glad that you’re lifeless,
Forever and ever
I’m glad that you’re lifeless,
Forever and ever
Even today.

You've got a strange voice, and a curious appearance so
At times, you were praised extravagantly at how magnificent they are
But because you don’t understand emotion
You didn’t know how to rejoice or the warmth of their hands

You didn’t know, you didn’t know
Or at least… you shouldn’t have known
But going round and round, what we struggled our way to
Was a future I hadn’t even imagined

Long time no see. I’m sorry.
Congrats. Take care.

Fun nights and empty mornings,
From your point of view, are nothing but records
Shattered dreams and emotional scars --
You simply slip past them as if they’re just scenery

I’m glad that you’re lifeless
Forever and ever
I’m glad that you’re lifeless,
Forever and ever
Even today.

Unchanging love and fleeting passion,
From your point of view, are nothing but code
Righteousness, evil, and days unrecoverable
In front of you they couldn’t matter less

Being here, and disappearing away
From your point of view, they aren’t such mysterious things
The ends of this earth or the mysteries of life
In front of you, they couldn’t matter less

I’m glad that you’re lifeless,
Forever and ever
I’m glad that you’re lifeless,
Forever and ever

Not just a good-for-nothing dream,
Amassing up extraordinary trash,
Faintly, you sing
Is the future fun?
I don’t really know
But let me stay here for just a little bit longer
