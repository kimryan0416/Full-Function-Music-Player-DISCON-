A robot made by a lonely scientistIn almost every way a "miracle"But this miracle wasn't enoughThere was one thing it couldn't run:A program called "Kokoro"Centuries passLeft all aloneThe miracle robot pleadsI want to know how he feltWorking till his dying dayMaking it for meMy "Kokoro"Just now it started, a quickening miracleFor some strange reason the tears won't stopWhy am I shaking? The accelerating beatIs this the "Kokoro" I wanted?Now I can say these words of truthAnd offer them to youThank you...For bringing me into this worldThank you...For the days spent togetherThank you...For all you've given meThank you...Forever I'll sing
